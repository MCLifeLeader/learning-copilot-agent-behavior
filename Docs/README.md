## How to run this experiment

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Locate the pre-created issues .md files in the `Docs` directory and review them.
4. Create two branches from the `main` branch, based on your development IDE and GitHub Copilot Agent you'll be using:
    - `agant/vs-code`
    - `agent/vs-2022`
5. Using the pre-created issues, start implementing the features in the respective branches using GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode.
    - For VS Code, use the `agant/vs-code` branch.
    - For Visual Studio 2022, use the `agent/vs-2022` branch.
    - Create the issues in GitHub and assign the issue to GitHub Copilot to complete the implementation.
6. Compare the implementations in each branch and analyze the differences in how GitHub Copilot assisted in each environment.
