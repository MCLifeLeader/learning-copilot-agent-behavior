# Create a chat page for my website that is designed to interface with a LLM

- Create a page called "Chat"
- Add a link to Chat on the navigation bar
- Add a main window and a chat input window
- Add a submit button to send the message to the LLM and verify that the message is sent
- Verify that the message is sent to the LLM and the response is displayed in the chat window
- Format the chat messages as follows:
  - Use a chat bubble style for both sent and received messages
  - Sent messages should be aligned to the right
  - Received messages should be aligned to the left
  - Use different colors for sent and received messages to distinguish them
- Use `2025-05-31_12-58-09.png` and `2025-05-31_13-00-12.png` as references for the design
